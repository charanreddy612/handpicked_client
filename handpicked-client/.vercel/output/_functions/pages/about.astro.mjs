HandPicked is a simple promise: verified coupons, real savings, no
        expired junk. A small team tests and curates each code so shoppers spend
        less time guessing and more time saving.
</p> <h2>How we verify coupons</h2> <ul> <li>We test codes against live carts before publishing.</li> <li>
We re-check high-traffic merchants daily and others on a rolling
          cadence.
</li> <li>
We label limited-time or single-use codes clearly when applicable.
</li> </ul> <h2>Editorial standards</h2> <p>
We disclose affiliate relationships where relevant and never accept
        payment to list a code that does not work as described. Trust comes
        firstâ€”always.
</p> <h2>Contact us</h2> <p>
