      <h1>About Saving Harbor</h1>
      <p>Saving Harbor is a simple promise: verified coupons, real savings, no expired junk. A small team tests and curates each code so shoppers spend less time guessing and more time saving.</p>

      <h2>How we verify coupons</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We test codes against live carts before publishing.</li>
        <li>We re-check high-traffic merchants daily and others on a rolling cadence.</li>
        <li>We label limited-time or single-use codes clearly when applicable.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Editorial standards</h2>
      <p>We disclose affiliate relationships where relevant and never accept payment to list a code that does not work as described. Trust comes firstâ€”always.</p>

      <h2>Contact us</h2>
