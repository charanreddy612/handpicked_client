      <h2>How we verify coupons</h2>
      <p>
        Trust is the foundation of everything we do — here’s how we make sure
        the coupons you see actually work:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We test codes against live carts before publishing.</li>
        <li>
          High-traffic merchants are re-checked daily; others are reviewed on a
          rolling cadence.
        </li>
        <li>
          We clearly label limited-time or single-use codes so you know what to
          expect.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Editorial standards</h2>
      <p>
        We disclose affiliate relationships where relevant and never accept
        payment to list a code that does not work as described. Your trust comes
        first—always.
      </p>
